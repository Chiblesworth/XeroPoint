# XeroPoint
This is an Android mobile application for Processing Solutions Inc. It a clone of the MX Merchant Express application with some added features
needed from Processing Solutions.

It is built with React-Native. React Native was chosen because of my previous experience with React for web applications. Also, I was more interested in making a true Native application rather than a website with a native wrapper.
